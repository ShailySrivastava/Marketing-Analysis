## Task 1: Data Overview
Objective: Understand the dataset structure.
Steps:
Load the dataset: Import the dataset into a
data analysis tool such as Python with

information about the number of entries,
columns, and data types.

## Task 2: Gender Distribution
Objective: Visualize gender distribution in
the dataset.
Steps:
Extract Gender Information: Identify
and extract the gender column from the
dataset.
Visualization: Create a simple
visualization, such as a bar chart or pie
chart, to represent the distribution of
genders in the dataset.

## Task 3: Descriptive Statistics
Objective: Present basic statistics for
numerical columns.
Steps:
Identify Numerical Columns: Review the
dataset to identify columns containing
numerical data (e.g., age, income).
Calculations: Use statistical functions
(e.g., mean(), median(), std()) to calculate
the mean, median, and standard deviation
for each numerical column.

between factors.
Steps:
Select Relevant Columns: Identify columns
such as age, investment duration, and
expected returns for correlation analysis.
